# Cline Recursive Chain-of-Thought System (CRCT) - v8.2

Welcome to the **Cline Recursive Chain-of-Thought System (CRCT)**, a framework designed to manage context, dependencies, and tasks in large-scale Cline projects within VS Code. Built for the Cline extension, CRCT leverages a recursive, file-based approach with a modular dependency tracking system to maintain project state and efficiency as complexity increases.

- Version **v8.2**: 🤖 **LOCAL LLM & DUAL-TOKEN EMBEDDINGS** - Automated Resolution & Precise Context
    - **Automated Placeholder Resolution**: New `resolve-placeholders` command uses local LLMs (via `llama-cpp-python`) to verify 'p' dependencies in batches, significantly reducing manual verification time and API costs.
    - **Dual-Token Schema**: Refactored metadata to track both `ses_tokens` (for embeddings) and `full_tokens` (for total file size), enabling smarter context window management.
    - **Enhanced Documentation Parsing**: Specialized SES extraction for structured docs, improving semantic search for requirements and design specs.
    - **Dependency-Aware Cache**: Cache invalidation now cascades through logical file dependencies, ensuring analysis consistency.
- Version **v8.1**: ⚡ **PERFORMANCE & STABILITY** - Batching and Caching Overhaul
    - **Tracker Batch Collection**: New `TrackerBatchCollector` system for atomic, high-performance tracker writes with rollback support.
    - **Advanced Caching**: Enhanced `@cached` decorator with dynamic file dependencies (`file_deps`), mtime-based invalidation, and automated path tracking.
    - **Optimized I/O**: Refactored `tracker_io` with local lookup caching to eliminate redundant file parsing during updates.
    - **Report Filtering**: `report_generator` now supports `EXCLUSION_PATTERNS` to eliminate false positives and groups multiple occurrences for cleaner analysis.
    - **Windows Path Consistency**: Standardized on Uppercase drive letters for improved compatibility across different Python environments.
- Version **v8.0**: 🚀 **MAJOR RELEASE** - Embedding & analysis system overhaul
    - **Symbol Essence Strings (SES)**: Revolutionary embedding architecture combining runtime + AST metadata for 10x better accuracy
    - **Qwen3 Reranker**: AI-powered semantic dependency scoring with automatic model download
    - **Hardware-Adaptive Models**: Automatically selects between GGUF (Qwen3-4B) and SentenceTransformer based on available resources
    - **Runtime Symbol Inspection**: Deep metadata extraction from live Python modules (types, inheritance, decorators)
    - **PhaseTracker UX**: Real-time progress bars with ETA for all long-running operations
    - **Enhanced Analysis**: Advanced call filtering, deduplication, internal/external detection
    - **Breaking Changes**: `set_char` deprecated, `exceptions.py` removed, new dependencies (`llama-cpp-python`), requires re-run of `analyze-project`. See [MIGRATION_v7.x_to_v8.0.md](MIGRATION_v7.x_to_v8.0.md)
- Version **v7.90**: Introduces dependency visualization, overhauls the Strategy phase for iterative roadmap planning, and refines Hierarchical Design Token Architecture (HDTA) templates.
    - **Dependency Visualization (`visualize-dependencies`)**:
        - Added a new command to generate Mermaid diagrams visualizing project dependencies.
        - Supports project overview, module-focused (internal + interface), and multi-key focused views.
        - Auto-generates overview and module diagrams during `analyze-project` (configurable).
        - Diagrams saved by default to `<memory_dir>/dependency_diagrams/`.
        - **NEW** integrated mermaid-cli to render dependency diagrams as .svg files. (experimental stage, subject to change in rendering process)
            - Performs well under 1000 edges to render, struggles with more than 1500 edges. Will reliably time-out with large 4000+ edge diagrams.
            - Requires additional dependency installation, should work via `npm install`
    - **Dependency Analysis and Suggestions**
        - Enhanced with python AST (for python)
        - Enhanced with tree-sitter (for .js, .ts, .tsx, .html, .css)
        - More to come!
    - **Strategy Phase Overhaul (`strategy_plugin.md`):**
        - Replaced monolithic planning with an **iterative, area-based workflow** focused on minimal context loading, making it more robust for LLM execution.
        - Clarified primary objective as **hierarchical project roadmap construction and maintenance** using HDTA.
        - Integrated instructions for leveraging dependency diagrams (auto-generated or on-demand) to aid analysis.
        - Refined state management (`.clinerules` vs. `activeContext.md`).
        - Split into Dispatch and Worker prompts to take advantage of new_task
    - **HDTA Template Updates**:
        - Reworked `implementation_plan_template.md` for objective/feature focus.
        - Added clarifying instructions to `module_template.md` and `task_template.md`.
        - Created new `roadmap_summary_template.md` for unified cycle plans.
- Version **v7.7**: Restructured core prompt/plugins, introduced `cleanup_consolidation_plugin.md` phase (use with caution due to file operations), added `hdta_review_progress` and `hierarchical_task_checklist` templates.
- Version **v7.5**: Significant baseline restructuring, establishing core architecture, Contextual Keys (`KeyInfo`), Hierarchical Dependency Aggregation, enhanced `show-dependencies`, configurable embedding device, file exclusion patterns, improved caching & batch processing.

## Key Features

- **Recursive Decomposition**: Breaks tasks into manageable subtasks, organized via directories and files for isolated context management.
- **Minimal Context Loading**: Loads only essential data, expanding via dependency trackers as needed.
- **Persistent State**: Uses the VS Code file system to store context, instructions, outputs, and dependencies. State integrity is rigorously maintained via a **Mandatory Update Protocol (MUP)** applied after actions and periodically during operation.
- **Modular Dependency System**: Fully modularized dependency tracking system.
- **Contextual Keys**: Introduces `KeyInfo` for context-rich keys, enabling more accurate and hierarchical dependency tracking.
- **Hierarchical Dependency Aggregation**: Implements hierarchical rollup and foreign dependency aggregation for the main tracker, providing a more comprehensive view of project dependencies.
- **Enhanced Dependency Workflow**: A refined workflow simplifies dependency management.
    - `show-keys` identifies keys needing attention ('p', 's', 'S') within a specific tracker.
    - `show-dependencies` aggregates dependency details (inbound/outbound, paths) from *all* trackers for a specific key, eliminating manual tracker deciphering.
    - `add-dependency` resolves placeholder ('p') or suggested ('s', 'S') relationships identified via this process. **Crucially, when targeting a mini-tracker (`*_module.md`), `add-dependency` now allows specifying a `--target-key` that doesn't exist locally, provided the target key is valid globally (known from `analyze-project`). The system automatically adds the foreign key definition and updates the grid, enabling manual linking to external dependencies.**
      *   **Tip:** This is especially useful for manually linking relevant documentation files (e.g., requirements, design specs, API descriptions) to code files within a mini-tracker, even if the code file is incomplete or doesn't trigger an automatic suggestion. This provides the LLM with crucial context during code generation or modification tasks, guiding it towards the intended functionality described in the documentation (`doc_key < code_key`).
    - `resolve-placeholders`: **(NEW in v8.2)** Automates the verification of unverified dependencies ('p') using a local LLM. This makes the resolution process significantly more efficient and less costly than using larger API-based models.
      *   Example: `python -m cline_utils.dependency_system.dependency_processor resolve-placeholders --tracker <path_to_tracker.md>`
    - `determine-dependency`: **(NEW in v8.2)** Performs a detailed local LLM analysis between two specific keys to verify their relationship with full reasoning.
      *   Example: `python -m cline_utils.dependency_system.dependency_processor determine-dependency --source-key <key> --target-key <key>`
   - **Dependency Visualization (`visualize-dependencies`)**: **(NEW in v7.8)**
    - Generates Mermaid diagrams for project overview, module scope (internal + interface), or specific key focus.
    - Auto-generates overview/module diagrams via `analyze-project`.
    - **NEW in v7.90** Now generates .svg image files for diagram visualization if the mermaid-cli dependency is installed.
- **Iterative Strategy Phase**: **(NEW in v7.8)**
    - Plans the project roadmap iteratively, focusing on one area (module/feature) at a time.
    - Explicitly integrates dependency analysis (textual + visual) into planning.
- **Refined HDTA Templates**: **(NEW in v7.8)**
    - Improved templates for Implementation Plans, Modules, and Tasks.
    - New template for Roadmap Summaries.
- **Configurable Embedding Device**: Allows users to configure the embedding device (`cpu`, `cuda`, `mps`) via `.clinerules.config.json` for optimized performance on different hardware. (Note: *the system does not yet install the requirements for cuda or mps automatically, please install the requirements manually or with the help of the LLM.*)
- **File Exclusion Patterns**: Users can now define file exclusion patterns in `.clinerules.config.json` to customize project analysis.
- **Code Quality Analysis**: **(NEW in v8.0, Improved in v8.1)**
    - **Report Generator**: A tool (`report_generator.py`) that performs AST-based code quality analysis.
    - **Incomplete Code Detection**: Identifies `TODO`, `FIXME`, empty functions/classes, and `pass` statements using robust Tree-sitter parsing.
    - **False Positive Filtering**: **(NEW in v8.1)** Added `EXCLUSION_PATTERNS` to filter out common false positives like `sql.Placeholder`.
    - **Condensed Reporting**: **(NEW in v8.1)** Groups multiple occurrences of the same issue in a file for more readable reports.
    - **Unused Item Detection**: Integrates with Pyright to report unused variables, imports, and functions.
- **Advanced Caching and Batching**: **(MAJOR UPDATE in v8.1)**
    - **Tracker Batching**: Collects all tracker updates in memory and writes them in a single operation, significantly reducing disk I/O.
    - **Atomic Updates**: Features rollback support to maintain tracker integrity if a batch write fails.
    - **Intelligent Invalidation**: Caches now automatically invalidate based on file modification times (mtime) and specific path arguments.
- **Modular Dependency Tracking**:
    - Utilizes main trackers (`module_relationship_tracker.md`, `doc_tracker.md`) and module-specific mini-trackers (`{module_name}_module.md`).
    - Mini-tracker files also serve as the HDTA Domain Module documentation for their respective modules.
    - Employs hierarchical keys and RLE compression for efficiency.
- **Automated Operations**: System operations are now largely automated and condensed into single commands, streamlining workflows and reducing manual command execution.
- **Phase-Based Workflow**: Operates in distinct phases: Set-up/Maintenance -> Strategy -> Execution -> Cleanup/Consolidation, controlled by `.clinerules`.
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Ensures transparency with step-by-step reasoning and reflection.
